          <h3>Why Blac Haxs?</h3>
          <p>Conceivably deriving out of necessity, African Americans and other people of color are innately conservationist. The environmentalism movement promotes the very things people of color are particularly adept: reusing, reducing, repairing, and repurposing. Still, people of color are underrepresented in environmental conversations and disproportionately impacted by environmental injustice. Pollution, lack of restoration or conservation, magnify oppression which contributes to the poor health and economic stagnation of their communities.</p>
          <p>We started Blac Haxs to be part of “the taking charge of your own narrative” and the collective self-actualization of the African American and Black community. Along the way, and with a bit of humor, we learned there are many ways for African Americans and people of color (in fact all peoples) to use a little talent and creativity to create and achieve more. We call some of these creative ways Haxs or Hacks. Hacks are the talents, skills and creativity used that help us live more efficiently with an aim to become more environmentally aware and build Black wealth in America.</p>
          <h4>Vision</h4>
          <p>Blac Haxs promulgates environmentalism and economics in the Black community to improve health and wellbeing, peace of mind and happiness—security, and generational wealth.</p>

          <ul class="card">
            <li>Promote and celebrate the talent, creativity, ingenuity, and the culture of African Americans and people of color in reusing, re-purposing, recycling, rethinking, and reenergizing, to protect the environment, efficiently use our limited resources, and increase wealth.</li>
            <li>Obliterate environmental oppression and injustice for African Americans and people of color.</li>

    <!-- CULTURAL ENVIRONMENTALISM -->
    <section class="section" id="cultural">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h3>Cultural Environmentalism</h3>
        <p>Environmentalism in Black communities is not a trend; it is a living memory and a living practice. Historically, families stretched resources through repairing, reusing, mending, and sharing—long before these practices were branded as green. Grandparents rinsed jars to store staples, hemmed clothing to pass down to siblings, and cultivated small garden plots to supplement food budgets and increase nutrition. These practices protected health, conserved money, and strengthened bonds.</p>
        <p>Today we name and celebrate this wisdom. Cultural environmentalism centers the talent, creativity, and ingenuity of African Americans and people of color. It honors the dignity of skilled work—sewing, fixing, cooking, crafting, and community mutual aid—and connects these traditions to climate stewardship, local resilience, and generational wealth building. When we repurpose and repair, we keep value circulating in our neighborhoods; when we buy intentionally, we vote with our dollars for the future we want.</p>
        <p>We also confront environmental injustice. From heat islands and food deserts to proximity to pollution, Black communities are often placed in harm’s way. Cultural environmentalism insists on restoration, green infrastructure, and equitable policy—so our health and our environment rise together.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p><strong>Call to action:</strong> map what your family already does that is green—saving jars, mending, carpooling, sharing tools—and then choose one new act each month: plant herbs, start a neighborhood swap, repair a small appliance, or switch a disposable habit to a reusable one. Small consistent steps compound into wealth, health, and hope.</p>

    <!-- MINIMALISM -->
    <section class="section" id="minimalism">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h3>Minimalism for People of Color</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>We take pride in having “made it”. Often, we demonstrate “making it” by showcasing things. Reaching success may be represented by the amount that was spent or the number of things we have. For some, it may be an attempt to overcome the effects of white supremacy and oppression. However, in our efforts to “show” what we have, we decrease the value of our culture and destroy attaining generational wealth. It is not only counterproductive to buy what you don’t really need just to make a statement, but it magnifies the assault on the Black dollar, because our money goes right back into the hands of those outside of our community.</p>
          <p>We need to focus on our community and our environment by taking special care of our resources and slow ourselves down to build ourselves up. We support the adoption of the minimalist lifestyle. Minimalism is a way of life where you are free to do more that is meaningful, have more of what is meaningful, which strongholds the well-being of you, your family and your community. This way may not be for everyone but for many it has allowed a greater sense of freedom.</p>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <h4>The benefits of minimalism are:</h4>
          <ol class="card">
            <li>Clarity and Peace of mind — by removing excess, your decisions become simpler and your daily life becomes calmer, reducing the noise that competes for your attention.</li>
            <li>Better health — less clutter lowers stress, which can improve sleep, diet choices, and overall physical and mental health.</li>
            <li>More room in your heart instead of using it to store your love for your “treasures” — valuing people and purpose over possessions opens space for relationships and growth.</li>
            <li>Be an example for your family and community — practicing restraint and intentionality can inspire others to live within their means and prioritize what matters.</li>
            <li>Less stress — fewer obligations to maintain, clean, and upgrade leaves more energy for creativity and rest.</li>
            <li>Cleaner home — with fewer items, organization is easier; surfaces and rooms breathe, creating a healthier environment.</li>
            <li>Getting to know the Joneses instead of trying to keep up with them — relationships replace competition, strengthening neighborhood bonds.</li>
            <li>Be more productive — a focused space supports focused work and learning without the drag of constant distraction.</li>
            <li>More time — spend less time shopping, cleaning, and repairing; spend more time with family, faith, service, and joy.</li>
            <li>Greater purpose — when clutter leaves, purpose enters; you can align daily actions with your calling.</li>
            <li>Leaving the past in the past — releasing items tied to hurt or nostalgia frees you to live in the present.</li>
            <li>Have more things of quality vs quantity — investing in durable, sustainable items reduces waste and long‑term cost.</li>
            <li>Extra money — fewer impulse buys and redundant items mean more savings and margin for investing.</li>
            <li>Saving the environment — buying and discarding less lowers resource use and landfill burden; reusing and repairing extend life cycles.</li>
            <li>Showing yourself and the world what you value most — your space becomes a testimony to your priorities and culture.</li>
            <li>Better relationships — less clutter, more eye contact; less spending, more giving; more presence, less pressure.</li>
            <li>Leaving more for the next generation — wealth transfers more easily when it isn’t trapped in depreciating stuff.</li>
            <li>Lifetime memories — experiences and service create stories that possessions can’t match.</li>
            <li>Ability to do the work you love — reduced expenses expand your options to pursue calling over mere income.</li>
            <li>And much more — minimalism is a practice, not perfection; it adapts with seasons and culture to keep you free.</li>
